Gabriel Jerome Solomon
Bankers Algorithm, Homework programming question implementation

Question from Professor Elkady

Program a simulation of the bankerâ€™s algorithm. Your program should cycle 
through each of the bank clients asking for a request and evaluating whether it 
is safe or unsafe. Output a log of requests and decisions to a file.
